/**
 * 
 * NOTES:
 * The MIDI protocol seems to have the first byte be an indicator of wether
 * a note was pressed or released, but my portable grand is all sorts of weird,
 * so here is my best understanding of what is going on
 * 
 * Byte 0: Whether something happened. 15 = nothing, 9 = something
 * Byte 1: Same as byte 0, but with numbers 354 and 144
 * Byte 2: Note number
 * Byte 3: note velocity. This is the only indicator of wether the note was pressed or released.

// This array is written to by the MIDI in realtime, but with true values only. That is to say the piano com thread only sets when
// notes are pressed, but doesn't clear the values when they are released. When the com thread writes to this array, a dirty flag is set.
// A slow frequency poll from the main thread occasionally coppies this buffer and clears all the values. A mutex is used when this operation
// is executed.
bool logicalStateBuffer[_PIANOSIZE];

// This array serves the purpose of replacing the functionality of note pressed events. It is ocasionlly coppied from the logicalStateBuffer 
// and uses no mutex so it may be read from at any frequency. this is a way of differentiating the diference between
// multiple note presses and a note just being held down without using a circular event buffer. When a note is pressed, the array
// is written to and a flag is set. The LED logic layer can then set the note value back off without the note having to be released.
// This makes subsequint reads from the array apear that the note is not pressed which means that any true value in the array is
// in effect a note pressed "event". This can only cause errors if a note is pressed more often than the array is polled.
